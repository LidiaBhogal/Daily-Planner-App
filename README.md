# Daily-Planner-App

## Description

The app should:

Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.

Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.

Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

Persist events between refreshes of a page.
